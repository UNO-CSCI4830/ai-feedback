## Testing Data

The `testing-datasets.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook can be used to save example {concept, rubric, exemplar} to use for testing. The easiest way to do this is to copy-and-paste from a Code.org level, such as https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2024/lessons/17/levels/7 (requires a teacher account)

From there, you can paste into the Jupyter notebook and it will format everything and save as a JSON file.

If you're having trouble running the notebook from your own environment, you should be able to run it in Google Colab - https://colab.research.google.com/github/
